<h1>summary of application development and implementation</h1>

<p>
First we decided on our business value. We chose a customer/account service as a business value for a bank
because that banks need to easily give their customers services such as withdraw, deposit and so on. 

We created two diffirent services, we started developing RESTful service.
We made entities for the customer and account. The data of the entities are saved in a h2 database.
The endpoints of the RESTful service have the operations of: see all customers, see customer by name, deposit to account,
withdraw from account.
